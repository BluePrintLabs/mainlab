           <h5 class="text-focus-in"><b>Question:</b> What is HTML?<h6> 
           <h6 class="text-focus-in"><b>Answer:</b> HTML stand for Hyper Text Markup Language. It's the foundational code that runs a web page. I often refer to it as the Foundation of your house. With a combination of tags you can design the base layout of any web page. <a href="/class/learn.css" download>

             <b>Q:</b> So what does it look like how do I start?
           </h5>    
            <h6 class="text-focus-in2">  
              <b>A:</b> Luckily for you, HTML is accepted in most browsers and on most computers. It's important to keep in mind any website or webapp is just a collection of hosted files. So in order to start building with HTML you'll need.... 
          

           <h5 class="text-focus-in3">
            <b>Q:</b> That's right a hosted HTML file!
            <h5>
            <h6 class="text-focus-in3">
            <b>A:</b> You can host it locally or in the cloud on<a href="www.Github.com">Github</a>. Yes, don't over complicate it. All you need is a file that's stored as .html instead of something like .txt or .csv
               
             So break out your textpad/notepad on your computer, or your favorite code <a href="Https://Atom.io">editor</a> and save a file as (index.html). Why did we name it index instead of something like webpage.html? Well you always start with your homepage otherwise known as your index page.
                
                Move onto the next page if you have your index.html file open and ready to start editing.
