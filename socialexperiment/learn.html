             <b>Q:</b> What is Open Source and why would anyone do it?
           </h5>    
            <h6 class="text-focus-in2">  
              <b>A:</b> It's the best way to speed up scientific discovery. When someone publishes their research under an Open Source License others can utililze it in their own ways thus adding to the overall research being done on that topic/issue.
