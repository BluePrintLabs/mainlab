           <h5 class="text-focus-in"><b>Question:</b> What is a CSS Library?<h6> 
           <h6 class="text-focus-in"><b>Answer:</b> In simple terms, it's just a bunch of CSS. We've built out CSS Classes for other people to reference. You can download the file <a href="/lowPolyCssLibrary.css" download>
            <img src="/lowPolyCssLibrary.css" alt="download" width="60" height="80">
          </a>
           and use it locally, or reference our CSS CDN.

             <b>Q:</b> Why do people make CSS Libraries?
           </h5>    
            <h6 class="text-focus-in2">  
              <b>A:</b> Librarys are common in many types of computer languages. For example the Bootstrap Library is extermely useful to refernce when building mobile first websites. They have compiled unique mobile desing for you to use instead of designing each style class yourself.

            <b>Q:</b> What is special about this CSS Library?
            <h5>
            <h6 class="text-focus-in3">
            <b>A:</b> Our goal is to compile Low Poly desing for CSS. Many unique libraries are out there for fancy design and text animation, however we have yet to come across a Low Poly one.<a href="www.something.com">Library</a>.
               
                Second is our <a href="www.something.com">Framework</a> and <a href="www.something.com">Form Builder</a> that is still in testing phase and need testers everyday.

                Last but most importanlty is our <a href="www.something.com">Learning Center</a>. For those new to code or technology it a great place to colloborate, learn, and contribute to the open source community.
